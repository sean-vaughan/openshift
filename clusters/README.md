# clusters Directory

The `clusters` directory contains directories which define the cluster-name
context for ArgoCD Applications. The ArgoCD Applications are named by the
`<app-name>.yaml` files contained within the cluster-name subdirectory. Argo
Apps are named `<cluster-name>---<app-name>`.

The cluster directory name is a literal used to prefix the argo application name generated by the `/apps/app-of-apps/app-of-apps.yaml` Application Set definition.

The ArgoCD Application Set generates ArgoCD Applications based directly on the
cluster names defined by the directory names in this directory, and the base of
the `/clusters/<cluster-name>/<app-name>.yaml` filename. For example, a
directory named `k8s-sno` with a `openshift-gitops.yaml` file inside will
generate an Argo Application named `k8s-1---openshift-gitops`.
